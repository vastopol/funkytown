Haskell notes:

cp *.hs ..; rm *; cp ../*.hs .; rm ../*.hs

Starting from GHC 8.0.1, top-level bindings are supported in GHCi,
In GHCi 7.x or below, you need a let to define things in it.

do notation

main = do
        ... code ...


printing = putStrLn

types = :type

type to str = show

[] list
() tuple

list prepend = :
(:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]

list cat = ++
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]

list comprehensions

powers = [ 2^x | <- x [1,2,3,4] ]

map, foldl, foldr, filter, zip, zipWith, etc...
